!!! HOW TO RUN THE CODE !!!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Compile and run LexicalAnalyzer.java
2) Create a sample .C file which will be used as input in the same directory as the above progam.
3) Type the fileName of the above .C file as the input when you run LexicalAnalyzer.java
4) You can also use the given MyTestCfile.txt as a testing file.

P.S.: Code is not uniform and readable because I've had very less time and i just wanted to get over with it as soon as possible.

Feel free to copy-paste and use this code, but please do not claim it as your own code.

Thank you :)
